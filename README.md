Personal portfolio in making using [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap), [Font Awesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome), [Devicon](https://github.com/konpa/devicon/), [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery), and [jQuery bez plugin](https://github.com/rdallasgray/bez)

## Why?
Since CodePen decided to break and the support isn't replying, I might as well host it on here and test it locally from now on.

### Gulp? For this? Really?
Yes. I just spent the last 2 days learning how to use it since I have been spoiled by CodePen and how easy it is to use and make stuff in it. It started as a teeny-tiny idea and it quickly became what it is now (a lot of modules and things going on).

There are some unnecessary dependencies (for now), but I want to leave them there since I do mean to expand the project further.

### It looks messy...
The files are a mess right now since I was trying to make the website quickly and then go back and clean up which would have happened much sooner. I'm looking at you, Gulp *shakes fist*

### You know better?
PM me somewhere or open an issue, I'd love to know more. o/
